Frogger- https://editor.p5js.org/evansoucy17/sketches/PGlKpEcog

For this assignment I created a line of code that created a basic frogger game. The code consists of two main parts: the setup function and the draw function. In the setup function, the canvas is created and the cars are generated using a for loop that creates a new instance of the Car class for each car.Then in the draw function, the background is drawn, the lanes are drawn on top of that. I decided to have the lanes grey to mimic a road and the "saftey zone" is grass. The cars  moved back and forth along the x-axis within their lanes. I then created a  keyPressed function to move the frog based on which arrow key is pressed. The checkCollisions function is called to check for collisions between the frog and the cars.
